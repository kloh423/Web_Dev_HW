I found that reading the "Five Important Considerations for Wireframing" was very interesting since it gave me more insight as to how I should approach wireframing. Although a lot of the considerations are very self-explanitory, such as "clarifying the problem" or "knowing your tools," these steps are usually overlooked when I approach a problem and this helps to remind me what step I missed.
